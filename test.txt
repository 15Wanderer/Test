In the future I am going to be a nuclear fusion researcher

But Artem Kharko will point out that there's no good way to collect the energy produced by a fusion reaction!

And Ishan will come in and put a blanket at absolute zero over the reaction site, blocking out all heat and light, therefore giving us lots of energy to use.
